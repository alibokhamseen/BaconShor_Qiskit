# BaconShor_Qiskit
The Bacon-Shor Code is a quantum error correction scheme that provides a simple yet effective method for detecting and correcting errors in quantum systems. This repository implements the Bacon-Shor code using Qiskit, designed to be simple but not efficient due to Qiskit simulators' nature.

## Features
Initialization of logical qubits in computational and superposition states.
Syndrome extraction using Z and X gauge measurements.
Error correction with lookup tables.
Support for logical gates (Z, X, and CX) on logical qubits.
Simulation with noise models and automated result interpretation.
